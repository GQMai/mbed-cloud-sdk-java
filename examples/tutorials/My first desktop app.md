This command generated all the files (e.g. helper scripts, example code, etc.) necessary for a java application.

As we want to integrate the SDK into our application, we need to add a dependency to it in 'build.gradle' file.
Open this file in an editor and copy the snippet related to Gradle from https://bintray.com/armmbed/mbed-cloud-sdk/mbed-cloud-sdk into the 'dependencies' section.
It should be something like:
*/

compile 'com.arm.mbed.cloud.sdk:mbed-cloud-sdk:1.x.y'

/*
You can also comment out the dependency on 'guava' as it is not required and add the following line to tell the logger not to log anything.
*/

compile 'org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:1.7.25'

In an editor/IDE of your choice, open src/main/java/App.java and add the following code in the 'main' function after the greeting line 'System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());'
