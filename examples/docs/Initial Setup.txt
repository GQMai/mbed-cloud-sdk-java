// an example: Initial setup
/*
If using Gradle, you can initialise your project, as follows:
*/
> gradle init --type java-application
/*
Then, add the following dependency to 'build.gradle' file (change 'x', 'y' and 'z' by the appropriate version numbers) :
*/
implementation 'com.arm.mbed.cloud.sdk:mbed-cloud-sdk:x.y.z'
/*
Next time you build your project, the dependencies will be fetched and stored in your package manager cache. 
You are then ready to start working with the SDK.
*/
// end of example
